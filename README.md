Working test.js covers all functions in todo.js. 

`git clone` this repo, `cd` this repo, and `npm install` to get the application running. You can test on localhost a myriad of ways; `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` will work for this project (Python 2 version of the command).

Todo.js acts as a model for an inline script tag in index.html. 

The inline script includes functionality for working with the DOM (event listeners and delegation) and also strips out the Class structure defined in Todo.js and replaces it with a functional, browser-compatible approach.

`npm test` (or `npm run test`) will run the test.js scripts for all functions in todo.js.
